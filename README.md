## React Native: From idea to production
This is the companion guide for the talk "Building and publishing native, cross-platform mobile app from the ground up"

### Idea
Remember, it all starts with an idea. React Native and Expo are great technologies, but they are just tools in the engineer's toolbox to bring outstanding ideas to life. 
You probably don't want to develop another to-do list app; what are your interests? What are you passionate about? What is something small that is missing from your daily life?
As you find inspiration throughout your day, write those ideas down and keep track of them. You are much more likely to carry a project to its completion, and thus learn new tech along the way,
if you are passionate about the idea you are bringing to life. 

### The state of mobile app dev
Here are some fun statistics. Remeber, thousands of new apps are launched every week, what will make yours stand out?

### Approaches
In the talk I propose considering cross-platform as your way to develop, but if you are interested in diving deeper into the topic, (check out this article)[https://dzone.com/articles/native-vs-hybrid-vs-cross-platform-how-and-what-to].

### Getting started with Expo
When you're ready to get to the keyboard and start developing, I highly recommend the Expo documentation. So, rather than repeat the great work they have already done, (you should go check them out)[https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/]
